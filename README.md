## Deployed version

- dApp deployed with Vercel: [https://decentraland-dapp.vercel.app/](https://decentraland-dapp.vercel.app/)

- Dummy contract deployed at Rinkeby: `0x92805969C03C76Df4633Cb94dE16C0b168664760`

## Local Setup

1. Run `cp .env.example .env` and fill the environment variables
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

You will also need to setup a local ethereum development environment and deploy the Dummy Token there, to do that [follow these instructions](https://github.com/decentraland/dummy-token#setup).

Please set the `REACT_APP_TOKEN_ADDRESS` in the `.env` file.

## Features included

- Routing: Implemented `connected-react-router` to handle the route changes and manage side-effects and components to render.
- Network detection: The project will only allow the user to use the supported network (Rinkeby for the deployed version and localhost locally). Unfortunately looks like MetaMask doesn't support changing it the localhost one, it will suggest the change but the network won't change after accepting the prompt.

- Account change detection: Re-fetch the token balance on the account change event.
- Transfer validation: `react-hook-form` was used to provide a basic validation during the token transfer. It will validate the address is a valid ETH one, that the amount is positive and that the user has the balance to make that transfer.

- Testing: the logic included in the sagas was testing using `redux-saga-test-plan`.
- Toasts: I used the `toast` module from `decentraland-dapps` to manage and render toasts to provide feedback to the user.

## Notes / Future improvements

- I noticed that locally
- Note that the `transfer` reducer has a `Transfer[]` in its state. I was planning to create a history of transactions but I was already extended from the original request.
- A validation that is contract address is valid while fetching the token should be included.
- I haven't found a use case for using `reselect`. I've used it in the past to avoid heavy computations repetition but I couldn't find a good usage from it in here.
- It would be nice to have listen to the `Transfer` event from the contract so the balance can update if the user recieves tokens.
- Add a catch for those browsers without a provider injected (if MetaMask is not installed for example)
